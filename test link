# Test Report – Functional Testing Lab (Note-Taking App)

## 🧩 1. Unit Test
**Function Tested:** `saveNote()`  
**What It Checked:** Whether the app prevents saving a note when the title or content is empty.  
**Result:** The test failed — notes can still be saved with empty fields.  
**Bug Found:** [Issue 001 – Notes not saved when title field is left blank](https://github.com/wambuachris38/noteapp/issues/1)

## 🔗 2. Integration & System Tests
**Steps Tested:**
- Typing a note and clicking “Save Note”  
- Editing an existing note  
- Deleting a note  

**What Worked Well:**
- Notes appeared immediately after saving.  
- UI was simple to use.  

**What Didn’t Work:**
- Edited notes didn’t refresh on screen.  
- Deleting sometimes removed the wrong note.  

**Bugs Found:**
- [Issue 002 – Edited note not updating in display list](https://github.com/wambuachris38/noteapp/issues/2)  
- [Issue 003 – Delete button sometimes deletes wrong note](https://github.com/wambuachris38/noteapp/issues/3)

## 💭 3. Reflection
Testing the Note-Taking App helped me understand how **Unit**, **Integration**, and **System** testing differ:
- Unit tests check a single function’s logic.
- Integration tests confirm connected components work together.
- System tests simulate the user’s full experience.

The most confusing part was testing DOM updates with Jest, but reading the code and adding `document.body.innerHTML` setup helped me figure it out.  
I learned how to test front-end logic, simulate user interactions, and document bugs clearly using GitHub Issues.
